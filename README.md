# COVID19 Drug Discovery ðŸ’Š
My work on the CORD-19 dataset on Kaggle. I build a Word2Vec NN model to analyze the large text corpus of COVID-19 research papers to find potential drugs to consider for COVID-19. I also look at how the spread of the virus can be mitigated by analyzing policies adopted by different countries.
